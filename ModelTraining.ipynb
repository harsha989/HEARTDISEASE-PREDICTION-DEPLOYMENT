    "\n",
    "**Missing Data** is simply a blank space or surrogate value that indicates that we failed to collect data for one of the features. For example, if we forgot to ask someone's age, or forgot to write it down, then we would have a blank space in the dataset for that person's **age**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to deal with missing data:\n",
    "1. We can remove the rows that contain missing data from the dataset. This is relatively easy to do, but it wastes all of the other values that we collected. How a big of a waste this is depends on how important this missing value is for classification. For example, if we are missing a value for **age**, and **age** is not useful for classifying if people have heart disease or not, then it would be a shame to throw out all of someone's data just because we do not have their **age**.\n",
    "2. We can **impute** the values that are missing. In this context **impute** is just a fancy way of saying \"we can make an educated guess about about what the value should be\". Continuing our example where we are missing a value for **age**, instead of throwing out the entire row of data, we can fill the missing value with the average age or the median age, or use some other, more sophisticated approach, to guess at an appropriate value.\n",

    "So, we see that **age**, **restbp**, **chol** and **thalach** are all `float64`, which is good, because we want them to be floating point numbers. All of the other columns, however, need to be inspected to make sure they only contain reasonable values, and some of them need to change. This is because, while **scikit learn Support Vector Machines** natively support continuous data, like resting blood preasure (**restbp**) and maximum heart rate (**thalach**), they do not natively support categorical data, like chest pain (**cp**), which contains 4 different categories. Thus, in order to use categorical data with **scikit learn Support Vector Machines**, we have to use a trick that converts a column of categorical data into multiple columns of binary values. This trick is called **One-Hot Encoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you may be wondering, \"what's wrong with treating categorical data like continuous data?\" To answer that question, let's look at an example: For the **cp** (chest pain) column, we have 4 options:\n",
    "1. typical angina,\n",
    "2. atypical angina,\n",
    "3. non-anginal pain,\n",
    "4. asymptomatic\n",
    "\n",
    "If we treated these values, 1, 2, 3 and 4, like continuous data, then we would assume that 4, which means \"asymptomatic\", is more similar to 3, which means \"non-anginal pain\", than it is to 1 or 2, which are other types of chest pain. Thus, the support vector machine would be more likely to cluster the patients with 4s and 3s together than the patients with 4s and 1s together. In contrast, if we treat these numbers like categorical data, then we treat each one a separate category that is no more or less similar to any of the other categories. Thus, the likelihood of clustering patients with 4s with 3s is the same as clustering 4s with 1s, and that approach is more reasonable.\n",
    "\n",

    "**NOTE:** There are many different ways to do **One-Hot Encoding** in Python. Two of the more popular methods are `ColumnTransformer()` (from **scikit-learn**) and `get_dummies()` (from **pandas**), and the both methods have pros and cons. `ColumnTransformer()` has a very cool feature where it creates a persistent function that can validate data that you get in the future. For example, if you build your **Support Vector Machine** using a categorical variable **favorite color** that has **red**, **blue** and **green** options, then `ColumnTransformer()` can remember those options and later on when your **Support Vector Machine** is being used in a production system, if someone says their favorite color is **orange**, then `ColumnTransformer()` can throw an error or handle the situation in some other nice way. The downside of `ColumnTransformer()` is that it turns your data into an array and looses all of the column names, making it harder to verify that your usage of `ColumnTransformer()` worked as you intended it to. In contrast, `get_dummies()` leaves your data in a dataframe and retains the column names, making it much easier to verify that it worked as intended. However, it does not have the persistent behavior that `ColumnTransformer()` has. So, for the sake of learning how **One-Hot Encoding** works, I prefer to use `get_dummies()`. However, once you are comfortable with **One-Hot Encoding**, I encourage you to investigate using `ColumnTransformer()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, before we commit to converting **cp** with **One-Hot Encoding**, let's just see what happens when we convert **cp** without saving the results. This will just make it easy to see how `get_dummies()` works."

    "So we see that there are **14** features, or columns, in **X**. \n",
    "This is a problem because it would require a 14-dimensional graph, one dimension per feature used to make predictions, to plot the data in its raw form. If we wanted to, we could just pick two features at random to use as x and y-axes on our graph, but instead , we will use **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) to combine the **14** features into **2** orthogonal meta-features that we can use as axes for a graph. If you don't already know about PCA, don't sweat it. For now, just know that it is a way to shrink a 14-dimensional graph into a 2-dimensional graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we shrink the graph, let's first determine how accurate the shrunken graph will be. If it's relatively accurate, than it makes sense to draw the 2-Dimensional graph. If not, the shrunken graph will not be very useful. We can determine the accuracy of the graph by drawing something called a **scree plot**."
